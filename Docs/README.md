# Documentation Library

This folder contains architecture and game design documentation for **Pits of Despair**. Documentation is written for human reference and optimized for efficient AI agent consumption.

## For AI Coding Agents

When working on this project, **prioritize these documents** before conducting deep codebase exploration:

- **Efficiency**: Check relevant docs here first to quickly understand system architecture and design decisions
- **Context**: Use documentation to understand the "why" behind implementation choices
- **Accuracy**: Reference docs to ensure changes align with established patterns and architectural principles

**When to use documentation vs code exploration:**
- Use docs for: System architecture, design patterns, data formats, intended behavior, cross-system interactions
- Use code exploration for: Implementation details, current state, specific APIs, edge cases

## Conventions

- **File naming**: lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `action-system.md`, `ai-architecture.md`)
- **Format**: Markdown with clear headings for easy parsing and navigation
- **Structure**: Optimized for both human readability and AI consumption with scannable sections

## Project Overview

For general project information, see:
- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Game overview, mechanics, and technical stack
- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Development principles, code practices, and workflow

---

*As the project evolves, this library will grow to include comprehensive documentation on major systems, architectural patterns, and game design decisions.*
