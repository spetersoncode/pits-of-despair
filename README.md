# Pits of Despair

**Don't even think about trying to escape.**

## Overview

Pits of Despair is a classic-style tile-based dungeon crawler roguelike built with Godot 4.5.1 and C#. You are a prisoner condemned to die by exile into the Pits of Despair - a foreboding, ever-shifting dungeon complex filled with unspeakable horrors and deadly monsters.

The only way to survive is to descend deeper into the Pits, battling creatures, discovering treasures, and growing powerful enough to rule this nightmare realm rather than becoming its latest victim.

- **Tile-Based Movement**: Grid-based dungeon exploration with strategic positioning
