# Floor 1 Spawn Table
# Defines what creatures and items spawn on the first dungeon level.
# Uses a budget-based system with weighted pools for randomized spawning.

name: floor 1

# Budgets determine how many creatures/items spawn per level generation
# Values are dice notation (e.g., "2d20+60" = roll 2 twenty-sided dice, add 60)
creatureBudget:
  dice: "2d20+60" # Total creature budget points for this floor
itemBudget:
  dice: "5d10+25" # Total item budget points for this floor
goldBudget:
  dice: "10d20+100" # Total gold available for distribution

# Creature Pools
# Each pool has a weight (higher = more likely to be selected)
# The system randomly selects a pool based on weights, then spawns entries from it
creaturePools:
  # Common pool (70% weight) - Basic early-game enemies
  - id: common
    weight: 70
    entries:
      # Entry types:
      # - single: Spawns one creature
      # - multiple: Spawns a small group (uses count dice)
      # - band: Spawns a creature band (leader + followers)
      # - unique: Spawns once per level (not used here)

      # Multiple rats (weight: 2, more common than other entries)
      # Spawns 1-2 rats per occurrence
      - type: multiple
        creatureId: rat
        weight: 2 # Higher weight = more likely to spawn
        count:
          dice: "1d2" # Rolls 1d2 to determine how many

      # Multiple goblins (weight defaults to 1)
      # Spawns 1-2 goblins per occurrence
      - type: multiple
        creatureId: goblin
        count:
          dice: "1d2"

      # Single goblin scout (weight defaults to 1)
      # Spawns exactly one scout per occurrence
      - type: single
        creatureId: goblin_scout

      # Band example - INLINE definition
      # This demonstrates defining a band directly in the spawn table
      # Useful for one-off or level-specific band configurations (like this rat swarm)
      - type: band
        band:
          name: rat swarm
          leader:
            creatureId: elder_rat
            placement: center # Leader spawns in center of band area
          followers:
            - creatureId: rat
              count:
                dice: "1d4+2" # Spawns 3-6 rats around the leader
              placement: surrounding # Places followers around leader
              distance:
                min: 1 # Minimum tiles away from leader
                max: 2 # Maximum tiles away from leader

  # Uncommon pool (25% weight) - Tougher encounters
  - id: uncommon
    weight: 25
    entries:
      # Band example - EXTERNAL reference
      # This demonstrates referencing a band defined in Data/Bands/
      # Better for reusable bands used across multiple spawn tables
      - type: band
        bandId: goblin_pack # References Data/Bands/goblin_pack.yaml

  # Rare pool (5% weight) - Dangerous encounters
  - id: rare
    weight: 5
    entries:
      # Multiple goblin ruffians - tough enemies in small groups
      # count defaults to "1" when not specified
      - type: multiple
        creatureId: goblin_ruffian

# Item Pools
# Similar structure to creature pools: weighted pools with entries
# Item entries are simpler - just reference item IDs
itemPools:
  # Common items (70% weight) - Consumables and basic gear
  - id: common
    weight: 70
    entries:
      # All entries have weight: 1 by default (equal probability within pool)
      # Item IDs follow pattern: {type}_{name}

      # Healing potions
      - itemId: potion_healing_8

      # Stat buff potions (temporary bonuses)
      - itemId: potion_barkskin_2

      - itemId: potion_bulls_strength_2

      - itemId: potion_cats_grace_2

      - itemId: potion_bears_endurance_2

      # Utility scrolls
      - itemId: scroll_blink

      - itemId: scroll_confusion

  # Uncommon items (25% weight) - Better equipment
  - id: uncommon
    weight: 25
    entries:

      - itemId: weapon_spear

  # Rare items (5% weight)
